# Hacker Game (BullCowGame)

Play as a notorious hacker and hack your way through several firewall levels to unlock the files.

I took the Bull Cow base project and added a hacking twist. Using models sourced online and the tools in Unreal Engine 4 I revamped the look of the game and added some extra features such as basic levels, visible bulls and more.

Bull Cow game base project created by following the [Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/) by [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) on Udemy. I'm now taking what I've learnt after completing the course and updating the projects with more features, gameplay elements and skin. Aiming to get each game project to a releasable state and uploading to a free game hosting site such as [itch.io](https://itch.io/).
